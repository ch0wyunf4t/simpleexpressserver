# Simple Express Server

This can be used for testing your html/css files locally or can be used as a boiler plate for an express-based application.

# Requirements

Make sure you have the latest version of NodeJS and ExpressJS on your system. 

# Set up 

On Debian-based Linux: 

Clone the repository with 'git clone'. From the folder location with the file 'server.js', open the terminal.

Type 'npm i express' to install the ExpressJS pack to the app

Type 'npm init -y' to initialize the application with default values

Then type 'npm start' to start the application. You should see a message stating your server is running.

Open a browser to the URL http://localhost:8080 to see the default web page!

# ideas

Try building an express application on top of the server

Try changing the html file to your own page

Try adding a .css file to experiment with the styling
